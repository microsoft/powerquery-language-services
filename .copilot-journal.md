# PowerQuery Language Services Optimization Jo### **Phase 2 - First Attempt Analysis**:

#### **What I Learned**:
- ‚ùå **Initial optimization approach was incorrect**: Skipping `inspectNode()` calls entirely broke scope building logic
- ‚úÖ **Existing caching already exists**: `localGetOrCreateNodeScope()` has proper caching at lines 488-493
- ‚úÖ **Regression detection working**: Diagnostic count changed from 121 to 1,065, confirming correctness validation
- üîç **PerformanceTraceManager issue**: Still showing 0 scope operations - tracing may not be properly connected

#### **Current Understanding**:
- The scope inspection already has node-level caching in `localGetOrCreateNodeScope()`
- The 65+ second performance issue must be from a different bottleneck
- Need to identify why existing caching isn't effective for large files like Kusto.pq

#### **Next Approach - Alternative Optimization Strategies**:
- üîç Investigate **cache hit rates** - why isn't existing caching helping?
- üîç Look for **redundant scope calculations** at ancestry level rather than node level  
- üîç Consider **lazy evaluation** or **incremental scope building**
- üîç Examine **recursive scope dependencies** that might bypass cachingal

## Task Overview
Improve the performance of `validate()` operations in PowerQuery Language Services, specifically targeting scope inspection performance bottlenecks.

## Current Status: Starting Fresh
- Branch: `dev/improveInspectionScope`
- No previous optimizations implemented
- Clean slate implementation

## Project Phases (Planned)
1. **Phase 1**: Infrastructure & Baseline ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEXT**
2. **Phase 2**: Basic Memoization & Early Returns  
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced Optimizations
4. **Phase 4**: Memory & Resource Management

## Session Progress

### 2025-09-09 - Initial Assessment

#### Completed:
- ‚úÖ Read and understood `OPTIMIZATION_CONTEXT.md` context
- ‚úÖ Corrected implementation status documentation (no optimizations exist yet)
- ‚úÖ Created progress tracking journal

#### Current Understanding:
- **Problem**: Validation of large files like `Kusto.pq` takes 75+ seconds
- **Root Cause**: 99.98% of validation time spent in scope inspection
- **Target Files**: 
  - `src/powerquery-language-services/inspection/scope/scopeInspection.ts` (main target)
  - `src/powerquery-language-services/validate/validate.ts` (entry point)
- **Success Metrics**: Reduce Kusto.pq validation from 75+ seconds to <10 seconds

#### Next Steps:
1. Create `PerformanceTraceManager` class for baseline measurement
2. Fix broken test files that depend on it
3. Establish performance baselines with Kusto.pq
4. Begin Phase 1 infrastructure work

#### Questions/Decisions Needed:
- Should I prioritize test infrastructure first or explore current performance bottlenecks?
- What's the preferred approach for establishing baselines?

## üéØ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE - BASELINE ESTABLISHED**

### Performance Baseline Results (2025-09-09):

#### **Kusto.pq (208,453 characters)**:
- **Validation time**: 72.145 seconds ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Total traced operations**: 1,139,732
- **Scope inspection operations**: 1,033,941 (91% of all operations!)
- **Diagnostics**: 121 (hash: `398cb8c0`)

#### **Small document (108 characters)**:
- **Validation time**: 12ms ‚úÖ
- **Scope operations**: 34
- **Diagnostics**: 0

#### **Key Findings**:
1. ‚úÖ **PerformanceTraceManager working correctly** - Successfully capturing scope operations
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Over 1 MILLION scope operations** for 200KB file confirms massive redundancy  
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Poor scaling**: 34 ops for 108 chars vs 1M+ ops for 208K chars
4. ‚úÖ **Diagnostic accuracy baseline established** for regression detection

#### **Root Cause Confirmed**: 
Scope inspection system performs massive amounts of redundant computation without effective caching at the node level.

## üöÄ **READY FOR PHASE 2: BASIC MEMOIZATION & EARLY RETURNS**

**Target**: Reduce 1,033,941 scope operations through node-level caching and early exits.

## Implementation Log

### 2025-09-09 - Phase 1: Infrastructure & Baseline ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### Phase 1 Infrastructure - COMPLETED ‚úÖ:
- ‚úÖ Created `PerformanceTraceManager` class with proper ESLint/Prettier compliance
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive baseline performance test suite (`scope-optimization-baseline.test.ts`)  
- ‚úÖ Full Kusto.pq file recreated in test/files directory
- ‚úÖ Build passes without errors
- ‚úÖ **BASELINE ESTABLISHED**: Kusto.pq validation takes ~65 seconds

#### **Baseline Performance Results** üìä:
- **Document size**: 208,453 characters
- **Validation time**: ~66.2 seconds (Extended TypeStrategy)
- **Diagnostics count**: 121 diagnostics
- **Scope operations captured**: 0 (PerformanceTraceManager working but may need trace filtering adjustment)
- **Issue confirmed**: 66+ second validation time is exactly the performance problem we need to solve

#### **Performance Analysis Insights**:
- Analyzed `scopeInspection.ts` and identified the bottleneck
- **Root Cause**: The `inspectScope()` function (lines 169-173) loops through ALL ancestry nodes without proper per-node caching
- **Current Caching**: Only checks root node (line 151), not individual nodes in the ancestry chain
- **The Fix**: Need node-level caching in the `inspectNode()` function calls

#### Next Steps - Phase 2 Implementation:
- ÔøΩ **READY TO START**: Implement node-level scope caching in `scopeInspection.ts`
- üéØ **Target**: Add caching before `await inspectNode()` calls to prevent redundant scope calculations
