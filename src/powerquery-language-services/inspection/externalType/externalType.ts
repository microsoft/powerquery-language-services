// Static type analysis isn't always solvable when restricted to local values,
// eg. it could invoke a library function or reference a library value.
//
// We can't bake in the standard library into the language-services layer for a few reasons,
// the biggest being it's up to the service hosting Power Query as to what parts of the library are available.
//
// Instead an API was made to resolve external values, and it's up to the consumer of language-services to
// implement the resolver.
//
// We distinguish between two subtlely different kinds of external types: value and invocation.
// An external request is when there's some identifier not in the local scope.
// An invocation request is when a function invocation happens on some identifier not in the local scope.
//
// The reason for the distinction is that the implementation can be more creative with type resolution.
// Eg. `Table.AddColumn(tbl, "foo", each 1)` could be implemented so the evaluated type is a modification
// of its first argument.
